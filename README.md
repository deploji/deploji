Deploji is an open-source web app designed as an application deployment tool. It utilizes Ansible under the hood, uses Angular on the frontend and relies on a backend written mostly in Go and partly in Java.

Some of the feature include:
- Easy deploying of any application to any enviroment, development, testing or production
- Defining templates for specific usage of Ansible playbooks
- Storing SSH keys and inventories
- Fine-grained access control
- Creating channels for email or webhook notifications

Deploji is being actively maintained and developed. If you encounter any problem or want to submit a new idea, please report them in the issue section of this repository.
